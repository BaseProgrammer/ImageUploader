# ImageUploader to [0x0.st](https://0x0.st)
Allows you to execute this and store images on 0x0.st

## How To Use:

First download the file using Git...
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/BaseProgrammer/ImageUploader
```

or use WGET...
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BaseProgrammer/ImageUploader/main/upload
```

Then make the script executable...
```sh
$ chmod 755 upload
```

Now use the script!
```sh
./upload [IMAGE LOCATION HERE] # Replace [IMAGE LOCATION HERE] to the path of your image or the local image.
```

# P.S.
## You can also upload files on here but you have to make sure it follows the rules of the [0x0.st](https://0x0.st) website (as well as the photos too). Also feel free to use and keep it, it's easy to code and there isn't a license.
